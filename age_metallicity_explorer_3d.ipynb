    "    \"This notebook provides a simplified interface for exploring age-metallicity and [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] patterns in different regions of the Milky Way disc. It uses 3D normalizing flow models that focus only on these three key chemical evolution parameters.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"By examining these parameters, we can understand how different stellar populations are distributed across the Galaxy and gain insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way disc.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"3. Use the interactive widgets to explore different parameters and visualization options\"\n",
